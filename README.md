This Perl program demonstrates an uncommon bug related to the iteration order of Perl hashes.  Hashes in Perl do not guarantee a specific iteration order; the order may vary between Perl versions or even between different runs of the same program. This can lead to unexpected behavior if your code relies on a particular order.  The solution shows how to maintain order by using a different data structure.
